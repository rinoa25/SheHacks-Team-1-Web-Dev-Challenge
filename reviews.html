              <p>From Taylor Swift’s album “Red”, an old breakup song from 2012 has been given a 10-minute version “All Too Well”, which is rich in detail and is supersized in length. The incarnation of “All Too Well” describes her relationship with her ex and as always her storytelling skills in the song are extraordinary. Many listeners who are or were in a relationship can relate to this song. I would definitely give this song a 5/5 rating due to the power and meaning behind it.</p>

              <p>From Drake’s Certified Lover Boy album, the popular song Knife Talk featuring 21 Savage and Project Pat, deserves a 4/5 stars. The music starts off with a sample from Project Pat’s verse from the song “Feed the Streets”. Then 21 Savage continues, and Drake comes along as well. The dynamic between 21 Savage and Drake makes the song match the aesthetics of the beat playing in the background. The song's entire presentation is clean, and the lyrics are catchy which makes the audience want to sing along.</p>
